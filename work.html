						<h4 class="font-alt">ABOUT</h4>
							Applying for the postion to become the assistant to <a href="http://rlgoldenberg.com"> Rachel Goldenberg</a> during her last semester of college in Spring 2017, Sarah has had the privilege to assist her for now over a year, helping Rachel in any way she can. From learning the ropes of a PA on Sarah's first real shoot when Rachel directed a commercial, to advancing her organizational management skills, Sarah's time with Rachel has changed her life forever. One of the most valualbe skills Sarah has gained was learning how to anticpaite someone's needs and executing them before they are even requested, in turn making someone's life easier.
							
							<br><br>

							<h4 class="font-alt">DUTIES</h4>
					
							As an assistant, Sarah has learned countless of indispensable skills. Her daily duties include managing Rachel's itinerary and assisting with Rachel's upcoming feature, Valley Girl. The pre-production stages were filled with  meetings, location scouts and overall preparation for the five week shoot. During production Sarah helped Rachel with general production duties, such as communicating with crew or simply making sure Rachel stayed healthy on the consecutive fourteen hour night shoots. Often you could find Sarah moving around set with two backpacks (one for her, one for Rachel), making sure Rachel's never got lost  the during the entire location-based production. Now in post, Sarah assists Rachel through research for Valley Girl related tasks, general assistant duties, coding a <a href="http://rlgoldenberg.com"> new website</a> for Rachel, and holding paws with Rahcel's cat, <a href="valleyGirl.html"> Elizabeth</a>.
